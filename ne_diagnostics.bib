abstract = {A two-color absorption spectroscopy strategy has been developed for measuring the column density and density-weighted path-average temperature of the absorbing species in nonuniform gases. This strategy uses two transitions with strengths that scale nearly linearly with temperature. In addition, measured lineshapes are used to accurately model absorbance spectra. As a result, the column density and densityweighted path-average temperature of the absorbing species can be inferred from a comparison of signals measured across a nonuniform line of sight (LOS) with simulated signals calculated using a uniform LOS. This strategy is demonstrated with simulations of water-vapor absorption across a nonuniform LOS with temperature and composition gradients comparable to those in hydrogen-air diffusion flames. In this demonstration, both the column density and density-weighted path-average temperature of water vapor are recovered to within 0.5{\%}. {\textcopyright} 2013 Optical Society of America.},

abstract = {A diagnostic has been developed to measure velocity and translational temperature in the plume of a 1-kW-class arcjet thruster operating on hydrogen. Laser-induced fluorescence with a narrow-band cw laser is used to probe the Balmer $\alpha$ transition of excited atomic hydrogen. The velocity is determined from the Doppler shift of the fluorescence excitation spectrum, whereas the temperature is inferred from the lineshape. Analysis shows that although Doppler broadening is the only significant broadening mechanism, the fine structure of the transition must be taken into account. Near the exit plane, axial velocities vary from 4 to 14 km/s, radial velocities vary from 0 to 4 km/s, and swirl velocities are shown to be relatively small. Temperatures from 1000 to 5000 K indicate high dissociation fractions.},

abstract = {Narrow-bandwidth semiconductor (GaAlAs) lasers have been used to record spectrally resolved atomic oxygen (7772 {\AA}) and argon (8425 {\AA}) lineshapes, corresponding to the 3s5S02→3p5P3 and 4s3P1→4p3D2 transitions, in an atmospheric pressure, 1.4- kW, 27-MHz inductively coupled argon-oxygen (12{\%} O2/argon) plasma. Electron number density and kinetic temperature values were inferred from the Stark- and Doppler-broadening components of the absorption lineshapes, respectively. The ionization temperature was calculated from the measured electron number density assuming ionization (Saha) equilibrium. Values of excited- state species number density and population temperature were determined from the frequency- integrated absorption coefficient for each transition. The difference between the ionization and population temperatures reflects the presence of a suprathermal electron number density in the flowfield. In addition, the excellent agreement between the kinetic and population temperatures suggests that the population in the oxygen and argon lowest excited states may be described by a Boltzmann distribution at the kinetic temperature. The methods presented extend effectively the range of semiconductor-laser diagnostics to mixed-gas plasmas and flowfields containing atomic oxygen. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {The absolute radiation measurements obtained in the electric arc-driven shock-tube facility at NASA Ames Research Center were analyzed to test the collisional-radiative model developed at cole Centrale Paris. Two conditions representative of Earth reentry at 10.54 and 11.17 km-s were investigated in the vacuum ultraviolet and infrared spectral ranges. For each of the conditions, the corresponding charge-coupled device images were analyzed. The electron number density was inferred from Stark-broadened nitrogen and H lines. Comparisons with the predicted electron number density profiles enabled us to validate the ionization rate constant model implemented in the flowfield solver and to accurately locate the shock front. For both freestream conditions and all the spectral ranges, the predictions of the initial intensity rises were improved when the total spatial smearing (due to the shock motion, the optics, and the camera) was taken into account. The nonequilibrium intensities observed in the vacuum ultraviolet and infrared spectral ranges were underpredicted by the collisional-radiative model when only electron-impact excitation and ionization processes were taken into account. Then, the effect of heavy-particle impact processes was studied by applying various multitemperature dissociation rate constant and vibration-dissociation coupling models as well as heavy-particle impact excitation models. The nonequilibrium peak intensities observed in the vacuum ultraviolet and infrared spectral ranges were shown to be controlled by heavy-particle impact excitation processes.},

A short overview of the available theoretical results is followed by the description of experimental techniques for the line shape and shift measurements. The influence of other broadening mechanisms to the Stark width and shift determination is discussed and a typical experimental procedure described. To select higher accuracy experimental data for plasma diagnostic purposes the available experimental results are analyzed and the uncertainty of recommended ones is estimated. The procedure for application of selected lines for plasma electron density diagnostics is described. The influence of ion dynamics to the width and shift of visible helium lines in low electron density plasmas is examined. In order to test theories the selected data are compared with results of various Stark width and shift calculations. Neutral atom lines asymmetry and new techniques for ion-broadening parameter measurements are reviewed. The studies of line widths and shifts along isoelectronic sequences of multiply ionized atoms are also discussed. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Based on Baranger's impact theory, the Stark line shape due to the interaction of a radiating particle (atom, molecule, ion) with electrons is studied. A semiclassical approximation is employed to determine the cross sections appearing in the line shape function. This formulation is applied to study the Stark broadening of atomic lines. The present implementation of the semiclassical approximation differs from earlier work in four aspects: The atomic line positions and oscillator strengths are taken from the database in the HyperRad code. Seaton's formula is used to enforce the reciprocity condition in the inelastic cross sections. Higher order correction is incorporated to the cross sections by a scaling factor. Also dynamic polarizability instead of static polarizability is used in the elastic cross section calculations. The Stark width and shift parameters of the N and O atoms are compared with the experimental data from the NIST compilations. In general, agreement in the UV region is better that the longer wavelength region. Also, the shift parameter is more sensitive to the computational method than the width. The shift parameter has not been used previously in flow field radiative heat load calculations.

These experiments have utilised cavity ringdown spectroscopy, allowing line of sight absorption to be measured on the optically forbidden 1 D← 3 P transition around 630 nm. Both the translational temperature and the absolute concentrations of the two most populated spin-orbit levels (J=1 and 2) have been determined as a function of plasma pressure at a fixed operating power of 300 W, allowing accurate determination of dissociation fraction; in all cases, the dissociation fraction is considerable, 10{\%}, maximising at 15{\%} for 20 mTorr. Time-resolved measurements of the rate of loss of the oxygen atoms when the plasma is extinguished have allowed the probability for wall-loss in the plasma chamber, $\gamma$, to be determined; in this case, for an aluminium surface, $\gamma$ is determined to be ca. a few ×10 −3 , with the exact value depending on pressure. In addition, the O − number density is shown to be an inverse function of pressure, showing a maximum of 1.6×10 10 cm −3 at 10 mTorr, falling to 2×10 9 cm −3 at 100 mTorr, and characteristic of a discharge operating in the detachment regime. The measured number densities are interpreted using calculated electron energy distribution functions and yield physically reasonable values for the electron number density.},

abstract = {An experimental investigation of the initial phase of shock produced ionization in argon, krypton, and xenon has been conducted in order to elucidate the atom—atom ionization reaction and to determine the atom—atom ionization cross sections. A high-purity shock tube was employed to heat these gases to temperatures in the range from 5000° to 9000°K at neutral particle densities of 4.4×1017, 7.0×1017, and 13.3×1017 cm−3, and impurity levels of approximately 10−6. A K-band (24-GHz) microwave system situated so that the microwave-beam propagation direction was normal to the shock tube, monitored the ionization relaxation process occurring immediately after the passage of the shock front. Electron density was calculated from the microwave data using a plane-wave—plane-plasma slab interaction theory corrected for near field effects associated with the coupling of the microwave energy to the plasma. These data, adjusted to compensate for the effects of shock attenuation, verified that the dominant electron-generation process involve a two-step, atom—atom ionization reaction, the first step (excitation to the first excited states) being rate determining. The quadratic dependence on neutral density associated with this reaction was experimentally demonstrated (with an uncertainty of ±15{\%}). The cross section, characterized as having a constant slope from threshold (first excited energy level), represented as the cross-sectional slope constant C, was found to be equal to 1.2×10−19±15{\%} cm2/eV, 1.4×10−19±15{\%} cm2/eV, and 1.8×10−20±15{\%} cm2/eV for argon, krypton, and xenon, respectively. The electron—atom elastic momentum-exchange cross sections derived from the microwave data correlated quite well with Maxwell-averaged beam data, the agreement for the case of argon being ±20{\%}; krypton, ±30{\%}; and xenon, within a factor of 2.},

Lineshape analyses of the measured spectral profiles enable the simultaneous and independent determination of kinetic and population temperatures. Measurements were made in the reflected-shock region with an initial gas mixture of 1.5{\%} N2 and 98.5{\%} Kr. The temperature range of the measuremenfs was 7800-lo600 K, and the pressure range was 0.38-2.31 am. At these conditions, a large fraction of N, dissociates into N-atoms. The narrow-bandwidth semiconductor laser was repetitively scanned at 8 kHz over 1.67 cm-I to obtain multiple absorption lineshapes for a given shock condition. Kinetic temperatures were determined by fitting the spectrally resolved lineshapes to Voigt profdes. and the population temperatures were inferred from the frequency-integrated absorption coeffcient The measured kinetic and population temperatum were found to be in good agreement with each other and with *retical calculations.

abstract = {Profile measurements for some multiplets of neutral oxygen and carbon have been carried out in a wall-stabilized d.c. cascade arc. A 3.4 m Ebert spectrograph with a dispersion of 1.1 mm/{\AA} was adapted to simultaneous photoelectric scanning of two sources and was used. Different gas mixtures (O2 + H2O, O2 + He, CO2 + Ar + H2) were used for the production of plasmas. Arc currents between 25 and 100 A yielded temperatures between 10,200 and 13,570 K and electron densities from 3.17 to 7.84 x 1016cm-3. Using the nonlinear least-squares method, theoretical profiles of different types were fitted to sets of experimental points, and broadening parameters of multiplet components were obtained for one multiplet of CI and four multiplets of OI in the visible spectral region. Our electron-impact half-widths and shifts are compared with theoretical values and other experimental data. Reasonable agreement between theoretical and experimental results are found for OI 3947 {\AA}, OI 4368 {\AA}, OI 5436 {\AA}, and CI 5798 {\AA}. For the multiplet OI 5330 {\AA}, the available theoretical values differ considerably and the difference between experimentally determined and calculated shift is too large. Griem's theoretical half-width is close to the experimental value. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

Radiation measurements are made in NASA Ames' Electric Arc Shock Tube at velocities from 3-15 km/s in mixtures of N 2 /O 2 and CO 2 /N 2 /Ar. The technique and limitations of the measurement are summarized in some detail. The absolute measurements will be discussed in regards to spectral features, radiative magnitude and spatiotemporal trends. Via analysis of spectra it is possible to extract properties such as electron density, and rotational, vibrational and electronic temperatures. Relaxation behind the shock is analyzed to determine how these properties relax to equilibrium and are used to validate and refine kinetic models. It is found that, for some conditions, some of these values diverge from non-equilibrium indicating a lack of similarity between the shock tube and free flight conditions. Possible reasons for this are discussed.},

We report the use of cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) using two distributed feedback diode lasers near 777.2 and 844.6 nm for sensitive, time-resolved, in situ measurements of excited-state populations of atomic oxygen in a shock tube. Here, a 1{\%} O2/Ar mixture was shock-heated to 5400-8000 K behind reflected shock waves. The combined use of a low-finesse cavity, fast wavelength scanning of the lasers, and an off-axis alignment enabled measurements with 10 $\mu$s time response and low cavity noise. The CEAS absorption gain factors of 104 and 142 for the 5P3 → 5S02 (777.2 nm) and 3P0,1,2 → 3S01 (844.6 nm) atomic oxygen transitions, respectively, significantly improved the detection sensitivity over conventional single-pass measurements. This work demonstrates the potential of using CEAS to improve shock-tube studies of nonequilibrium electronic-excitation processes at high temperatures.},

Summation over all contributing intermediate states accounts for the multiplicity of the levels involved and results in a width proportional to the geometrical mean of absorption and emission oscillator strengths. Higher multipole interactions are shown to be almost always negligible, and for Lyman-0. 'the iterated solution of the time-dependent Schrodinger equation describing the collisions is extended to fourth order. Estimated errors of its calculated width and of the widths of other lines are about 5{\%} in the validity regime of the impact approximation, apart from any uncertainties in oscillator strengths and statistical weight factors. impact-broadening theories' ' which in the case of Stark broadening (dipole-monopole interactions) have been found to give the best agreement with experiment. ' " In these theories weak interactions from distant collisions are treated exactly, and the necessary cutoff at small impact parameters and the contribution of close collisions are estimated in a self-consistent manner. Holtsmark's approach to the problem has been continued by Mead and his co-workers" " in the sense that actual results are only obtained in the limit of infinite atomic mass, which is equivalent to Holtsmark s quasi-static approximation. Theirs and the present work are therefore complementary, and it depends on the experimental situation which of the two theories is applicable. (Appropriate validity criteria are discussed in Sec. 5.) Reck et al. do account for the multiplicity of the levels (whose importance was first realized by Foley") by considering spin-orbit interactions, but their contention that the binary collision treatment may never be valid near the line center of self-broadened lines is not borne out for pure impact broadening. To disprove the validity of their contention for this special case consider a system consisting of two atoms described by a symmetrized wave function so that excited and ground-state atoms remain unspecified. (This description is adequate as long as Doppler effects can be neglected, because it then makes no difference whether or not the excited atom is, e. g., moving toward or away from the observer.) For the dipole-dipole interaction and the case of resonance the impact-broadening operator introduced in the next section can now be shown to have only diagonal matrix elements in the above representation. This follows because the operator as defined in Eq. (1) involves an average over relative 1. INTRODUCTIOH},

abstract = {A 1129 CONCLUSIONS The results of this experiment show that the values of the electron density determined by two-wavelength interferometry agree with the values determined from the Stark broadening of Hp and from the absolute continuum intensity at 5240 '. to within the experimental accuracy of about {\&}6oro. For the observed electron density of about 2){\&}10" cm ' at temperatures around 20 000'K, this agreement between the three methods of measurement shows the consistency of the theories used. Corrections to the continuum measurements were made for the overlapping Balmer lines using asymptotic-wing formulas. Also, the continuum formula includes the correction for the lowering of the ionization potential due to high-density plasma eBects. At these temperatures it is unnecessary to include the contributions due to H and H2+ continua, so that the continuum measurement of the electron density becomes quite reliable. These measurements indicate that the calculated half-widths of Griem, Kolb, and Shen for Stark-broadened Hp lines are actually better (4 oro) than the theoretical estimates of accuracy (10{\%}).Also, it can be inferred from this data that at these densities the Griem asymptotic-wing formulas for the Stark-broadened Hp and H{\~{}} lines are more accurate than the earlier Kolb, Griem, and Shen wing formulas. Concerning the interferometric technique, this study has shown that for the case of shock tubes it is especially important to use the two-wavelength refractivity formula instead of the single-wavelength formula to eliminate the systematic error due to the high neutral-particle density in the boundary layers. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS We would like to express our thanks to Edwin F. Vincent for his assistance throughout the course of the experiments. We would also like to thank Dr. A. C. Kolb for his encouragement and many useful discussions , Professor H. R. Griem for the suggestion of the high, neutral-particle density in the boundary layer near the walls of the tube and for numerous other discussions , John Fortna for assistance during the surruner of 1962 and at other times, Arlo Anderson for help with the calculations, and numerous members of the NRL Plasma Physics Branch for their advice and assistance. A hot plasma composed of helium and ionized nitrogen was created by reflecting the shock wave produced in an electromagnetic T tube. The plasma temperature was measured by monitoring three nitrogen-ion lines whose intensities are strong functions of temperature. The profiles of various lines emitted in the plasma were obtained by scanning with a monochromator from shot to shot. The half-width of He I 3889 L was compared with empirically corrected calculations to determine the electron density. Half-widths of various nitrogen-ion lines were measured from the impact-broadened profiles; their shifts were obtained by comparing these profiles with unshifted lines from a pulsed capillary discharge. The results indicate agreement between experiment and recent Stark-broadening calculations within 20'Po, except for lines originating from the 4f level where Debye screening effects are important. No evidence was found for plasma polarization shifts.},

The objective is to determine the electron number density in the post-discharge, with spatial and temporal resolution, to gain a better understanding of the discharge development and chemical kinetics. Electron number densities were measured in water vapor from the broadenings and shifts of the H $\alpha$ and H $\beta$ lines of the hydrogen Balmer series and of the atomic oxygen triplet at 777 nm. For an average reduced electric field of about 150 Td, high electron densities up to 3×10 18 cm −3 are measured at the cathode, up to 5×10 17 cm −3 at the anode, and up to 4×10 16 cm −3 in the interelectrode gap. The high density near the electrodes is attributed to ionization enhancement and secondary electron emission due to the high electric field in the plasma sheath. In the middle of the inter-electrode gap, we show that the electron density mainly decays by electron attachment reactions. The dissociation fraction of water vapor is estimated to be around 2{\%} in the middle of the gap.},

A test gas mixture of 1{\%} O2/Ar was shock-heated to temperatures between 8000 and 10,000 K and pressures between 0.15 and 1 atm. The time evolution of the atomic oxygen population in the 3 s 5S0 state was monitored by laser absorption at 777.2 nm. The measured O(3 s 5S0) population revealed multistage behavior that was not observed in previous measurements over a temperature range of 5300-7200 K. To interpret the multistage behavior, a three-level collisional-radiative model for atomic oxygen excitation kinetics was developed. The model utilized two independent temperatures, that is, heavy particle translational temperature Ttr and electron translational temperature Te, to describe the fundamental rate constants of atomic oxygen excitation because of collisions with heavy particles and electrons, respectively. The heavy particle excitation rate was inferred from the early stage of the measurement to be k(3P →5S0) = 3.4 × 10-27 (T/K)0.5(1.061 × 105 + 2 (T/K)) exp(-1.061 × 105 K/T) ± 50{\%} m3 s-1. The electron impact excitation rate constant of oxygen, electron impact, and heavy particle impact ionization rate constants of Argon were modified in the model to match the experimental population time histories. The modified rate parameters are also reported for the temperature range explored in the current study.},

The emitted spectrum was in the range 200-1000 nm and was recorded using an Echelle spectrograph equipped with a time-gated ICCD camera. The measurements were performed at several delay times (0-10 $\mu$s). Based on LTE assumption, the excitation temperature is derived using a Boltzmann plot of OI emission lines. The FWHM of the Stark broadened OI line at 844.65 nm is used for electron density measurements at different times.

abstract = {A rovibrational collisional model is developed to study the internal energy excitation and dissociation processes behind a strong shock wave in a nitrogen flow. The reaction rate coefficients are obtained from the ab initio database of the NASA Ames Research Center. The master equation is coupled with a one-dimensional flow solver to study the nonequilibrium phenomena encountered in the gas during a hyperbolic reentry into Earth's atmosphere. The analysis of the populations of the rovibrational levels demonstrates how rotational and vibrational relaxation proceed at the same rate. This contrasts with the common misconception that translational and rotational relaxation occur concurrently. A significant part of the relaxation process occurs in non-quasi-steady-state conditions. Exchange processes are found to have a significant impact on the relaxation of the gas, while predissociation has a negligible effect. The results obtained by means of the full rovibrational collisional model are used to assess the validity of reduced order models (vibrational collisional and multitemperature) which are based on the same kinetic database. It is found that thermalization and dissociation are drastically overestimated by the reduced order models. The reasons of the failure differ in the two cases. In the vibrational collisional model the overestimation of the dissociation is a consequence of the assumption of equilibrium between the rotational energy and the translational energy. The multitemperature model fails to predict the correct thermochemical relaxation due to the failure of the quasi-steady-state assumption, used to derive the phenomenological rate coefficient for dissociation.},

Most observations were made end-on, and the arc was operated in pure nitrogen as well as argon with a small admixture of nitrogen to avoid self-absorption problems, which mainly arose with the red and near-infrared lines. The electron density was determined from the well-known Stark half-width of the hydrogen H{\&} line, for which purpose a trace of hydrogen was added to the plasma. Our principal results are as follows: (a) Good agreement with the recent theoretical work by Griem and co-workers has been obtained; (b) consistent with theoretical predictions, ion-broadening effects are not noticeable; (c) the Stark widths and shifts for different lines in a multiplet are identical within the experimental precision (-3jo) as predicted by the theory; and (d) measurements performed over a range of transitions involving different quantum states agree equally well with the theoretical data, indicating that the atomic-structure part of theory is very adequate.},

Innovative optical instrumentation has been developed and implemented to meet the challenges posed from obtaining such data in these impulse facilities. Spatially and spectrally resolved measurements of absolute radiance of a travelling shock wave in EAST are acquired using multiplexed, time-gated imaging spectrographs. Nearly complete spectral coverage from the vacuum ultraviolet to the near infrared is possible in a single experiment. Time-gated thermal imaging of ballistic range models in flight enables quantitative, global measurements of surface temperature. These images can be interpreted to determine convective heat transfer rates and reveal transition to turbulence due to isolated and distributed surface roughness at hypersonic velocities. The focus of this paper is a detailed description of the optical instrumentation currently in use in the EAST and HFFAF.},

Much later they were introduced in the research of plasmas. In this foundation paper we will focus on optical-based diagnostics that are now for quite some time common use in the field of low-temperature plasma physics research.

The heterodyne signal from the two lasers and the optical measurements of the electrode spacing yield high-precision results. The observed scalar shifts are found to be 61.153(8) kHz (kV/cm) ' for rubidium and 39.400(5) kHz (kV/cm) for potassium.

Run 8) q'/(X-1) 1.77 1.95 1.45 2.56 0.73 1.41 1.76 An alternative method for the measurement of optical Stark shifts was recently developed in atomic lithium [1]. In order to test the validity of multiconfigurational Hartree-Fock (MCHF{\}} and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations used in the prediction of atomic parity violation, the method was subsequently applied to cesium [2]. In cesium the precision of the measurement was about 130 ppm, the most precise Stark shift measurement that we are aware of. These initial measurements have stimulated a flurry of theoretical activity that attempts to refine the atomic calculations to a comparable precision [3-5]. In order to establish similar benchmarks in other atomic systems, we have applied this refined method of measurement to rubidium and potassium. We have achieved results more than three orders of magnitude more precise than any previous measurements. These results provide valuable tests of atomic structure calculations, placing constraints on the large r behavior of the atomic wave functions and testing various techniques for summing the relevant infinite series. The method used for these measurements has been described in detail in Refs. [1,2]. One laser is locked to an atomic resonance line either in an atomic beam or in a saturated absorption cell. The frequency of this laser is fixed and serves only as a heterodyne reference. The second laser beam has its frequency shifted 60 MHz by an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). The shifted beam intersects an atomic beam at the center of a pair of precision electrodes. This second laser's frequency is then lacked so that the shifted frequency beam remains centered on the atomic resonance. The direct (unshifted) outputs of the two lasers interfere on an avalanche photo-diode. The resulting beat frequency (initially about 60 MHz) is monitored on a frequency counter. A well calibrated voltage is then applied to the electrodes, shifting the resonance frequency and the frequency of the second laser. The resulting change in the beat frequency, combined with the well-known electric field, yields a calibrated measurement of the Stark shift. The atomic-beam apparatus, the electrode structure, and its calibration are nearly identical to that previously described. For the rubidium experiment we use a saturated absorption cell with a length of 3 in. , maintained at a temperature of about 55'C to lock the reference laser. In potassium, we lock the reference laser to a second atomic beam, created by adding a pair of new apertures to our collimating plates in the atomic-beam apparatus. This second atomic beam was approximately 4 mm below the main beam and was monitored in the "field free" viewing region (see Ref. [1]{\}}.This separation of the source into two beams eliminated the possibility that optical pumping of the atomic beam in the first region (field free) might result in a shift in the second (field) region. The operating temperature for the atomic-beam oven was typically 175'C for rubidium and 200'C for potassium. The cavity stabilized diode lasers are similar to those described in Ref. [2]. Sharp model LT022MC laser diodes are used for generating the 795 nm light for the Run 1 2 3 A11 26 30 33 89 Shift [kHz (kV/cm)},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the procedure for plasma electron number density, N e, diagnostics based on the comparison of theoretical and experimental shape or width of hydrogen Balmer lines. Low N e diagnostics, requiring an extension of available theoretical Stark broadening data tables was examined first. The difficulties encountered during experimental line profile analysis at low N e are discussed and appropriate procedures suggested. The widely adopted deconvolution of experimental profile by fitting with a Voigt function is examined and it is shown that this deconvolution introduces large systematic error in Stark width determination. This uncertainty can be decreased but never completely avoided by fixing the Gaussian part of the Voigt function. Simple formulas of satisfactory accuracy for deconvolution at the half width of experimental profile were investigated and their application recommended. The contribution of Van der Waals broadening to the experimental profile is examined and the correction for its contribution discussed. Approximate and reliable formulas for the evaluation of N e from the Stark width were critically evaluated. To estimate the applicability of different sets of theoretical data for N e diagnostics, a comparison of theory versus experiments was carried out and best data tables were recommended. For low N e diagnostics the application of higher members of Balmer series is advised whenever possible. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This dissertation explores the link between civil-military relations and international conflict. In particular, I ask whether strategies that leaders invoke to protect themselves from their own militaries might under some conditions increase the risk of war. Even though civil-military relations is fundamental to state-building, and despite the sizable literature on domestic causes of international conflict, there is very little work on the international implications of regimes' efforts to protect themselves from their own militaries. My argument is that when coups are possible, usually leaders divide their armed forces into rival organizations that they intend to check and balance each other and protect the regime as a by-product of mutual suspicion. (I label this strategy counterbalancing). Counterbalancing depends on leaders' ability to keep their own armed forces apart by promoting conflict among them. But military elites may rebel if they come to understand how leaders profit from inter-organizational hostility. Hence, counterbalancing requires leaders to conceal control benefits they accrue when they induce their own forces to compete. Because international conflict conceals these benefits, leaders may invent enemies, prepare for war, and engage in low-level international disputes when their foundational objective is to use counterbalancing to subordinate their own militaries. Contrary to the sizable literature on scapegoating, my argument is that in the realm of civil-military relations regimes may use provocative foreign policy to reinforce institutional divisions rather than to achieve cohesion. The argument is tested via a multi-method strategy that includes a pooled, time-series analysis of almost every country in the world over the last two decades of the Cold War as well as historical case studies of civil-military relations in Syria in the early 1970's and Georgia in the mid-1990's.},

Mixtures of 1{\%} O2-Ar were shock-heated to 5400-7500 K, and two distributed-feedback diode lasers near 777.2 and 844.6 nm were used to measure time-resolved populations of atomic oxygen's 5S° and 3S° electronic states, respectively. Measurements were compared with simulated population time histories obtained using two different kinetic models that accounted for thermal nonequilibrium effects: (1) a multitemperature model and (2) a reduced collisional-radiative model. The former assumed a Boltzmann distribution of electronic energy, whereas the latter allowed for non-Boltzmann populations by treating the probed electronic states as pseudospecies and accounting for dominant electronic excitation/de-excitation processes. The effects of heavy-particle collisions were investigated and found to play a major role in the kinetics of O atom electronic excitation at the conditions studied.

abstract = {139 (II) Diode laser sensor is conducted to measure the gas temperature in the liquid-gas 2-phase counter flow flame. CloHzz and city gas were used as liquid fuel and gas fuel, respectively. Two vibrational overtones of H20 were selected and measurements were carried out in the spray flame region stabilized the above gaseous premixed flame. The path-averaged temperature measurement using diode laser absorption method succeeded in the liquid fuel combustion environment regardless of droplets of wide range diameter. The path-averaged temperature measured in the post flame of liquid-gas 2-phase counter flow flame showed qualitative reliable results. The successful demonstration of time series temperature measurement in the liquid-gas 2-phase counter flow flame gave us motivation of trying to establish the effective control system in practical combustion system. These results demonstrated the ability of real-time feedback from combustor inside using the non-intrusive measurement as well as the possibility of application to practical combustion system. Failure case due to influence of spray flame was also discussed.},

The inversion produced an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) signal at 845 nm. A probe laser tuned to this transition was crossed at a small angle with the pump beam.

Spectrally-resolved argon absorption lineshapes at 8115 and 8 104 A, corresponding to the 4s3P,-+4p3D, and 4s3P1+4p3D, transitions of argon, were recorded in a 1 kW, 27 MHz inductively-coupled argon plasma 11 mm downstream from the load coil. Lineshapes were fit to Voigt profiles, allowing inference of both Stark broadening and shift which, in turn, specifies the electron number density and the kinetic temperature. A population temperature for each of the probed levels was determined from frequency-integrated line intensities. The difference between ionization temperatures, determined from measured electron number-density values assuming Saha equilibrium between atoms and ions, and population temperatures suggests the presence of a suprathermal electron number density.

The diagnostic approach is based on generating a high-power beam in an optical build-up cavity and using the beam as a light source for Thomson scattering from plasma housed within the cavity. In our setup, a high-power (∼5W) fiber laser at 1064 nm allows an intra-cavity power of 11.7 kW in a two-mirror cavity for measurements in the plume of a BaOhollow cathode discharge. A study of plasma density and temperature was performed at various operating conditions. Electron densities and temperatures in the range of ∼1012 cm−3 and ∼3eV were measured, respectively. The high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the present measure- ments (SNR ? 1100) suggests the ability to measure signifi- cantly lower density plasmas in the range of ∼3 × 109 to 3 × 1010 cm−3, thereby extending current laser Thomson scattering diagnostic capabilities.},

abstract = {We describe an experimental and semi-quantitative theoretical investigation of the characteristics of two-photon-induced stimulated emission related to diagnostic applications. The laser power dependence, pressure dependence, and the spectral shape of the stimulated emission signal in CO are discussed and compared with those for laser-induced fluorescence. We also discuss decreases in the laser-induced fluorescence signal caused by the stimulated emission process, and propose a method for providing increased spatial resolution in measurements made using stimulated emission detection. PACS: 33.80.Wz, 42.55.Em, 82.40.Py Since the advent of the laser in the early nineteen-sixties, a variety of laser-based spectroscopic techniques have been developed for diagnostic purposes. These methods are extremely valuable for probing harsh environments such as flames, where the nonin-trusive nature and high spatial and temporal resolution obtainable with optical techniques are very useful. Spontaneous Raman scattering and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) are commonly used for measurements of temperatures and major species concentrations, and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) has been widely used for detecting minor species. For a comprehensive review of the application of these techniques to combustion diagnostics, see [1] and references therein. In the field of laser-induced fluorescence, the use of multiphoton excitation schemes has made it possible to detect flame species that would otherwise require VUV excitation, such as O [2], H [3], and CO [4]. In diagnostic applications of multiphoton (as well as single-photon) LIF, it has been commonly thought * that collision-induced processes and spontaneous emission generally dominate deexcitation from the laser-excited state. However, flame and cell experiments on atomic oxygen have recently shown that stimulated emission (SE) induced by two-photon laser excitation provides an additional deexcitation pathway [5]. After this demonstration, the effect has also been utilized for flame detection of carbon atoms [6], hydrogen atoms [7], and nitrogen atoms [8]. Similar effects have been observed earlier in many atomic and molecular species (see, for example, [9-12]). There seems to be some controversy and confusion over the origin of the emission, partly for semantic reasons. The process has been attributed to superradiance, superflu-orescence, and amplified spontaneous emission (or stimulated emission). The difficulty of determining the origin of the process in a particular study has recently been demonstrated by the use of the description "bidirectional emission" in order not to give it an incorrect designation [i 3]. Superradiance (also called Dicke superradiance [14]) and superfluorescence are coherent radiation from a small volume of dipoles initially prepared with a large degree of coherence, where there is a strong coupling between the atoms through the common},

abstract = {Cavity-enhanced absorption spectroscopy (CEAS) has generated much interest in shocktube kinetics studies because of its recent success in achieving improved sensitivity and high time resolution with robust optical alignment. While recent progress demonstrated experimental schemes including off-axis scanned-wavelength approach and on-axis ps-pulsed laser approach, that both successfully suppressed the laser-cavity coupling noise, this paper develops a theoretical model to predict the CEAS sensor performance that can be used as a design tool applicable to more generalized cases. The method models the optical field in the cavity based on the decentered Gaussian beam model, from which the cavity transmission spectrum and the laser-cavity coupling noise can be numerically calculated. The simulation results predict sensor performance for different cavity configurations and laser characteristics, including various degrees of laser-cavity mode-matching, laser linewidths, scanning rates, and cavity filling conditions. Simulation with example wavelengths in the ultraviolet, near-infrared, and mid-infrared showed increasing mode-matched beam waist size for increasing wavelengths. An off-axis alignment scheme was found to be capable of suppressing the coupling noise by two orders-of-magnitude at a moderate laser linewidth of 1GHz. Coupling noise level on the order of 1e-5 for scanned-wavelength off-axis alignment case with a narrowband mid-infrared laser was obtained by model calculation and agreed with experimental results within acceptable uncertainty range. The developed method can serve to guide future design and optimization of CEAS system in shocktube studies.},
